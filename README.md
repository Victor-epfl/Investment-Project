# International Portfolio Strategies â€“ Investment Project

This project explores and evaluates multiple international investment strategies using historical data across seven countries from April 2002 to December 2024.

We implement and compare the performance of:

- **International Diversification Strategy (DIV)**
- **Momentum Strategy (MOM)**
- **Long-Term Reversal Strategy (REV)**
- **Currency Carry Strategy (CARRY)**
- **Long USD (DOLLAR) Strategy**
- **Optimized Fund Allocation Strategy (STRAT)** using mean-variance optimization and volatility targeting

## Key Highlights

- Empirical performance analysis using Sharpe ratios, t-tests, and regressions
- Evaluation of diversification benefits across strategies
- Strategy overlays and optimized portfolio construction
- Fama-French 5-factor regression to assess market exposures
